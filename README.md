# BreakShift

**BreakShift** is a classic _Breakout_-style arcade game built with **C++** and the **[raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)** library. While currently a faithful clone of the original Breakout, it serves as the foundation for a more personalized take on the genre. New features and mechanics will be introduced as development continues.

## 🎮 Gameplay

Use your paddle to keep the ball in play and break all the bricks!

### Controls

- **Left / Right Arrow Keys** — Move paddle left/right
- **A / D Keys** — Alternate keys for paddle movement

## 🛠️ Built With

- **C++17**
- **raylib** — A simple and easy-to-use C library to enjoy videogame programming

## 🚧 Project Status

BreakShift is in **early development**. While the current version replicates the core gameplay of Breakout, future updates will explore original ideas and mechanics.

## 📦 Setup & Running

Whether you want to play BreakShift or explore the source code, here's how to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BreakShift.git
   cd BreakShift
   ```
2. Navigate to the `Build\` folder:
   ```
   cd Build
   ```
3. Run the pre-built exectuable:

- On **Windows**:  
  Double-click `BreakShift.exe`  
  _or_ run via terminal:
  ```
  ./BreakShift.exe
  ```

### 🧠 To View or Modify the Code

- Open the `BreakShift.sln` file in **Visual Studio**.
- **raylib is bundled with the project**: the header files and libraries are included in the `include/` and `lib/` folders respectively.
- No external raylib installation is required.
- Build and run the project using **F5** or the green Run button.

> ⚠️ Note: The Visual Studio project is configured to use the local `include` and `lib` directories for raylib.  
> Make sure all these folders remain intact if you move or copy the project.

## 🙅 Contributions

This is a **solo learning project**, so contributions are currently not being accepted. BreakShift is meant to be a personal milestone and proof of growth in game development.
